# üß† Mental Satahi

**Mental Satahi** is a mental health engagement and sentiment tracking platform designed to support individuals dealing with mental health challenges. The platform provides an AI-powered chatbot for conversational support, tracks users' emotional well-being over time, and offers periodic sentiment reports to promote self-awareness and mental clarity.

## üåü Features

- **Conversational Chatbot with Context Awareness**  
  Engage with a chatbot that retains session-based conversation history and uses it to respond meaningfully to user queries.

- **Sentiment Tracker**  
  Users can input journal-style text to detect and log emotional sentiment using a BERT-based sentiment classifier (implemented from scratch).  
  The classified sentiment is scored and used to track emotional trends over weekly, monthly, and custom periods.

- **Scheduled Email Reports**  
  A cron job, implemented using **Celery Beat**, sends users a summary of their weekly sentiment report via email.

- **Sentiment Report Generator**  
  Users can generate a full sentiment analysis report at any time, showing trends and emotional insights based on past entries.
